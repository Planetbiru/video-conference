## Demo

Currently, this project requires running a WebSocket signaling server on port `3000`. Open multiple browser tabs to simulate multiple participants.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-conference.git
cd video-conference
`

2. **Run signaling server**

   * The signaling server can be implemented in **PHP** or **Node.js**.
   * Start the server using one of the following commands:

# PHP

   * Join a room by passing `?roomId=yourRoom` in the URL.
